# What is this project

Its an insecure FaaS essentially, you can host your random snippets of code on here.  
Just make sure that it isnt security critical code.  
I have some security going on however, I have only allowed the http and net modules on here. Please let me know if other modules are required, I can write mock interfaces for fs if needed.
